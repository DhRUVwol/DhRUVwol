I am a Computer Science undergraduate with interests in quantum computing, machine learning, and full-stack system design. My work spans quantum chemistry simulations, VQE pipelines, OCR-based automation, EEG-to-text decoding, and modern web development.

My goal is to build systems that merge scientific computing with practical engineering.

## Areas of Focus
- Quantum computing (VQE, Shor’s Algorithm, IBM Quantum Runtime)
- Machine learning and applied deep learning
- Full-stack development with Next.js, Python APIs, and MongoDB
- Scientific computing and algorithmic problem-solving

## Selected Projects
- **Quantum Molecular Simulator** – VQE-based ground-state energy estimation (Qiskit, FastAPI, MongoDB)
- **EEG-to-Text Decoding** – Deep learning pipeline for translating EEG signals into text
- **OCR Automation System** – End-to-end document parsing and data extraction tool
- **Student Gymkhana Platform** – Full-stack portal for managing events, committees, and announcements

## Technical Skills
**Languages:** Python, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript  
**Frameworks:** Next.js, FastAPI, Flask, React  
**Quantum:** Qiskit, Qiskit Nature  
**Tools:** MongoDB, Git, Docker, Postman
